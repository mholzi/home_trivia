    "fun_fact": "Cows actually have different moos for different situations! They use different sounds to communicate with their calves, show distress, or express contentment. Scientists have identified at least 11 different types of cow vocalizations, each with its own meaning in the bovine social world.",

    "fun_fact": "Purple has been associated with royalty for thousands of years because purple dye was extremely expensive to make in ancient times. It came from murex snails, and thousands of snails were needed to make just a small amount of dye, making purple clothing a luxury only the wealthy could afford.",

    "fun_fact": "Spiders are arachnids, not insects, which is why they have 8 legs instead of 6 like insects do. Each leg has seven segments and is incredibly strong - a spider can lose a leg and regrow it during molting. Some spiders can even voluntarily detach a leg if caught by a predator, a process called autotomy!",

The novel introduced concepts like 'Big Brother,' 'thoughtcrime,' and 'doublethink' that have become part of everyday language. Orwell was inspired by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War and his observations of totalitarian regimes.",

Gold is one of the least reactive chemical elements, which is why it doesn't tarnish or corrode. All the gold ever mined in human history would fit into a cube with sides of about 21 meters - roughly the size of a tennis court!",

This fundamental rule was developed by mathematicians like Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century and forms the basis of calculus. The power rule is essential for understanding rates of change in physics, economics, and engineering applications.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "fun_fact": "Werner Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that you cannot simultaneously know both the exact position and exact momentum of a particle. This isn't due to measurement limitations but is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics. The principle has profound implications for our understanding of reality at the atomic level and helped establish quantum mechanics as a complete theory.",

This 'Copernican revolution' in philosophy influenced virtually every subsequent philosophical movement and established Kant as one of history's most important thinkers.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "fun_fact": "Legend has it that Carl Friedrich Gauss discovered this formula as a 9-year-old student when his teacher asked the class to sum the numbers from 1 to 100. While his classmates laboriously added each number, Gauss realized that pairing numbers (1+100, 2+99, etc.) always gave 101, and with 50 such pairs, the answer was 50×101=5050. This insight led to the general formula n(n+1)/2 for the sum of the first n natural numbers.",
