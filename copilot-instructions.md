# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Home Trivia Home Assistant Integration

Welcome to the **Home Trivia** Home Assistant party game! This repository contains a custom integration designed to provide a seamless, plug-and-play experience for Home Assistant users, along with a Lovelace card for easy UI interaction. Please follow these instructions to ensure all development aligns with project goals and user expectations.

---

## General Principles

- **Zero-Setup Philosophy**: All features, dependencies, and UI components must be automatically included and configured by the integration. Users should not need to perform manual setup steps beyond installing the integration.
- **Bundled Lovelace Card**: The integration must provide a Lovelace UI card out of the box, so users can add and use the game directly from the Home Assistant dashboard.
- **Cross-Language Support**: Code is a mix of JavaScript (for the frontend) and Python (for the backend integration). Maintain clear interfaces and documentation between these components.
- **User Experience**: Prioritize a fun, intuitive experience. All configuration should be possible via the Home Assistant UI, not YAML or code edits.

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Directory Structure

- `custom_components/home_trivia/`: Python backend for Home Assistant integration.
- `home_trivia_lovelace/` or `www/community/home_trivia/`: JavaScript frontend for the Lovelace card.
- `README.md`: Always update documentation with each release.
- `copilot-instructions.md`: (this file) Reference for Copilot and contributors.

### 2. Integration Packaging

- All frontend assets (JS, CSS, images) must be served by the integration or included in the repository.
- Use Home Assistant's `resources:` to register the Lovelace card automatically if possible.
- Provide manifest and version files as required by Home Assistant custom integrations.

### 3. Lovelace Card

- The card should be pre-configured and discoverable after installation.
- No manual editing of `ui-lovelace.yaml` should be required.
- Support all major themes and mobile responsiveness. The usage will be predominantly on mobile. 

### 4. Setup & Configuration

- Use config flows (`config_flow.py`) for any setupâ€”never require YAML.
- All settings (game options, UI preferences) must be adjustable from Home Assistant's web UI.
- Use a splash screen to capture all critical input data for the game with appropriate error messages an explanantions

### 5. Testing

- Provide thorough unit and integration tests for both backend and frontend code.
- Use Home Assistant's test tools for Python and appropriate frameworks for JS.

### 6. Content Standards

#### Mandatory Difficulty Levels
The game must support exactly these four difficulty levels:
- **Kids**: Perfect for curious minds around 10 years old! Fun questions about animals, colors, and basic facts.
- **Easy**: Great for testing what you learned in school with questions about geography, basic science, and history.
- **Medium**: University-level challenges! Dive deeper into literature, advanced science, and complex historical facts.
- **Hard**: University-level knowledge! Mind-bending questions about advanced topics, philosophy, and specialized knowledge.

#### Mandatory Categories
All trivia questions must be categorized into exactly these seven categories:
1. **Fun Facts** - Interesting and surprising facts from various domains
2. **History** - Historical events, figures, and periods
3. **Geography** - Countries, capitals, landmarks, and geographical features
4. **Music** - Musicians, genres, instruments, and musical history
5. **Literature** - Authors, books, poetry, and literary movements
6. **Science** - Biology, chemistry, physics, and scientific discoveries
7. **Politics** - Government systems, political figures, and civic knowledge

These categories and difficulty levels are mandatory and must be adhered to in all question content and game logic.
